Using constructors to add new book entries to a library


TODO:
- Style cards to they're all uniform height ** how to account for edge case (super long inputs) 
max character count?????
calculated based on at what point the card starts overflowing
it's not going to be responsive though...

have button positioned relative to bottom of card? so the info can move around a bit


- Side Scrolling div for Book overflow
- Remove book from library
- Local Storage
    - render library on page load
